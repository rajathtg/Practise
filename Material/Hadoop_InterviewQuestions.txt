Hadoop:
=======
1. What are the five V's associated with Big Data?
-Initially IBM had quoted 3 V's > Volume,Variety and Velocity
	Volume > It is the amount of data we're dealing with. (SocialNetworking, Medical Domain etc.)
	Variety > Each domain produces it's own type of data i.e. structured, unstructured and semi structured etc.
	Velocity > The speed the data is getting generated i.e. take example of FB and twitter each second there is a like,comment, audio or image or video upload.
Later came the,
	Veracity > The data which we receive cannot be always a complete one, there can be something missing, corrupted.so, how deal with such data.
	Value > The data what we received I want to know what is a importance / does it carry any value. Because once after we process it, it shouldn't go as complete waste that's y.
Note: Later few came up with Visualisation,Validity and Vocabulary etc, but above five are important.

2. What are the different structures of data?
-Structured >	Organised data format
		Data Schema is fixed
		Ex: RDBMS data etc.
-Semi_Structured > Partial organised data
		   Lacks formal structure of a data model
		   Ex: XML and JSON files etc.
-Unstructured > Un-Organised data
		Unknown Schema
		Ex: Multi-media files etc.
